# ACA-Py Governance

Maintainers and contributors are welcome to review the [draft technical charter for ACA-Py](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fNndB1G-P5KcKbpPROrVGWI7U5Yt7rf5vphssNokn9o/edit?tab=t.0). Comments are welcome, but note that the ACA-Py Maintainers have already approved the document (via [ACA-Py PR 3857](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy/pull/3857)), and LF Project Formation is in the process of finalizing the document.

Per the Linux Foundation:

- A technical charter is created for all new projects to define both the project operations and the IP policy.  
- We have proposed that the technical oversight for the ACA_Py project be handled by a “Technical Steering Committee” made up initially of the project’s maintainers.
- At a later date the ACA-Py TSC is free to evolve how membership on the TSC is determined to accommodate project growth and the evolution of its governance.
