    # The condition should check if the release tag starts with the LTS version prefix.
    # For example, if your LTS versions are prefixed with '1.2.', you can use:
    #   if: startsWith(github.event.release.tag_name, '1.2.')
    # This will ensure that the job only runs for releases that are tagged with LTS versions.
