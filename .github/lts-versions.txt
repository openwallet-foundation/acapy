# LTS Version Patterns
# Each line represents a version pattern that should be treated as LTS
# Use major.minor format (e.g., 1.2 for versions 1.2.x)
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are ignored

# Example: Uncomment the lines below to enable LTS for specific versions
# 0.11
# 0.12
# 1.0

# For testing purposes (remove in production):
0.0
