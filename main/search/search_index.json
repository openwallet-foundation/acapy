Maintained by the OpenWallet Foundation, ACA-Py began in the Hyperledger Indy/AnonCreds/Aries ecosystem and has evolved to include support multiple verifiable credential formats and exchange protocols. It serves as a foundational building block for Trust Over IP-based ecosystems.</p> <p>Visit the ACA-Py Plugins Store at https://plugins.aca-py.org to find ready-to-use functionality to add to your ACA-Py deployment, and to learn how to build your own plugins.</p>"},{"location":"#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>ACA-Py is a foundation for building Verifiable Credential (VC) ecosystems. It operates in the second and third layers of the Trust Over IP Model using a variety of verifiable credential formats and protocols. ACA-Py runs on servers (cloud, enterprise, IoT devices, and so forth), and is not designed to run on mobile devices.</p> <p>ACA-Py includes support for the concepts and features that make up Aries Interop Profile (AIP) 2.0. ACA-Py\u2019s supported features include, most importantly, protocols for issuing, verifying, and holding verifiable credentials using both Hyperledger AnonCreds verifiable credential format, and the W3C Standard Verifiable Credential Data Model format using JSON-LD with LD-Signatures and BBS+ Signatures. Coming soon -- issuing and presenting Hyperledger AnonCreds verifiable credentials using the W3C Standard Verifiable Credential Data Model format.</p> <p>To use ACA-Py you create a business logic \"controller\" that talks to an ACA-Py instance (sending HTTP requests and receiving webhook notifications), and ACA-Py handles the various protocols and related functionality. Your controller can be built in any language that supports making and receiving HTTP requests; knowledge of Python is not needed. Together, this means you can focus on building VC solutions using familiar web development technologies, instead of having to learn the nuts and bolts of low-level cryptography and Trust over IP-type protocols.</p> <p>This checklist-style overview document provides a full list of the features in ACA-Py.

This is used by a controller application (written in any language) to manage the behavior of the agent. The controller can initiate actions (e.g. issuing a credential) and can respond to agent events (e.g. sending a presentation request after a connection is accepted). Agent events are delivered to the controller as webhooks to a configured URL.</p> <p>Technical note: the administrative API exposed by the agent for the controller to use must be protected with an API key (using the --admin-api-key command line arg) or deliberately left unsecured using the --admin-insecure-mode command line arg.

This release strengthens stability, modernizes protocol support, and delivers important updates for AnonCreds credential handling. A small number of breaking changes are included and are detailed below.</p> <p>Updates were made to to the <code>askar-anoncreds</code> wallet type (Askar plus the latest AnonCreds Rust library), addressing issues with multi-ledger configurations, multitenant deployments, and credential handling across different wallet types. Wallet profile management was strengthened by enforcing unique names to avoid conflicts in multitenant environments.</p> <p>AnonCreds handling saw extensive refinements, including fixes to credential issuance, revocation management, and proof presentation workflows. The release also introduces support for <code>did:indy</code> Transaction Version 2 and brings better alignment between the ledger API responses and the expected schemas. Several API documentation updates and improvements to type hints further enhance the developer experience when working with AnonCreds features.</p> <p>Support for multi-tenancy continues to mature, with fixes that better isolate tenant wallets from the base wallet and improved connection reuse across tenants.</p> <p>Logging across ACA-Py has been significantly improved to deliver clearer, more actionable logs, while error handling was enhanced to provide better diagnostics for validation failures and resolver setup issues.</p> <p>Work toward broader interoperability continued, with the introduction of support for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) 2.0, as well as enhancements to DIDDoc handling, including support for BLS12381G2 key types. A new DIDComm route for fetching existing invitations was added, and a number of minor protocol-level and invitation flow improvements were made to strengthen reliability.</p> <p>The release also includes many improvements for developers, including a new ACA-Py Helm Chart to simplify Kubernetes deployments, updated tutorials, and more updates to demos (such as AliceGetsAPhone). Dependency upgrades across the project further solidify the platform for long-term use.</p> <p>Significant work was also done in this release to improve the security and integrity of ACA-Py's software supply chain. Updates to the CI/CD pipelines hardened GitHub Actions workflows, introduced pinned dependencies and digests for builds, optimized Dockerfile construction, and improved dependency management practices. These changes directly contribute to a stronger security posture and have improved ACA-Py's OpenSSF Scorecard evaluation, ensuring higher levels of trust and verifiability for those deploying ACA-Py in production environments.</p>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#130-deprecation-notices","title":"1.3.0 Deprecation Notices","text":"<p>In the next ACA-Py release, we will be dropping from the core ACA-Py repository the AIP 1.0 and RFC 0037 Present Proof v1.0 DIDComm protocols.

In addition to the AnonCreds updates, the most visible change is the removal of the \"in-memory wallet\" implementation in favour of using the SQLite in-memory wallet (<code>sqlite://:memory:</code>), including removing the logic for handling that extra wallet type.

The full list of PRs in this release can be found below. here are the highlights of the release:</p> <ul> <li>A formal ACA-Py Long Term Support (LTS) policy has been documented and is being followed.</li> <li>The default underlying Python version has been upgraded to 3.12. Happily, there were minimal code changes to enable the upgrade to 3.12 from the previous Python 3.9.</li> <li>A new ACA-Py Plugins Store at https://plugins.aca-py.org. Check out the plugins that have been published by ACA-Py contributors, and learn how to add your own plugins!</li> <li>We've improved the developer experience by enabling support in ACA-Py artifacts for the ARM Architecture (and notably, Mac M1 and later systems). To do so, we have removed default support for BBS Signatures. BBS Signatures are still supported in the codebase, and guidance is provided for how to enable the support in artifacts (Docker images, etc.) for those needing it. We look forward to updating the BBS support in ACA-Py based on libraries that include multi-architecture support.</li> <li>Pagination support has been added to a number of Admin API queries for object lists, enabling the development of better user interfaces for large deployments.</li> <li>Cleanup in the ACA-Py AnonCreds Revocation Registry handling to prevent errors that were found occurring under certain specific conditions.</li> <li>Upgraded pull request and release pipeline, including:<ul> <li>Enabling a much more aggressive approach to dependabot notifications, beyond just those for security vulnerabilities.

The work is not complete, as we are taking an incremental approach to adding DIDComm v2 support.</li> <li>A decorator has been added for enabling direct support for Admin API authentication. Previously, the only option to enable (the necessary) Admin API was to put the API behind a proxy that could manage authentication. With this update, ACA-Py deployments can handle authentication directly, without a proxy.</li> <li>We have dropped support for the old, archived Indy SDK. If you have not migrated your deployment off of the Indy SDK, you must do so now. See this Indy SDK to Askar migration documentation for guidance.</li> <li>Support added for using AnonCreds in W3C VCDM format.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#100-breaking-changes","title":"1.0.0 Breaking Changes","text":"<p>With the focus of the pull requests for this release on stabilizing the implementation, there were a few breaking changes:</p> <ul> <li>The default underlying Python version has been upgraded to 3.12.</li> <li>ACA-Py has supported BBS Signatures for some time. However, the dependency that is used (<code>bbs</code>) does not support the ARM architecture, and its inclusion in the default ACA-Py artifacts mean that developers using ARM-based hardware (such as Apple M1 Macs or later) cannot run ACA-Py \"out-of-the-box\". We feel that providing a better developer experience by supporting the ARM architecture is more important than BBS Signature support at this time. As such, we have removed the BBS dependency from the base ACA-Py artifacts and made it an add-on that those using ACA-Py with BBS must take extra steps to build into their own artifacts, as documented here.</li> <li>Support for the Indy SDK has been dropped. It had been previously deprecated. See this Indy SDK to Askar migration documentation for guidance. Hyperledger Indy is still fully supported - it's just the Indy SDK client-side library that has been removed.</li> <li>The webhook sent after receipt of presentation by a verifier has been updated to include all of the information needed by the verifier so that the controller does not have to call the \"Verify Presentation\" endpoint. The issue with calling that endpoint after the presentation has been received is that there is a race condition between the controller and the ACA-Py cleanup process deleting completed Present Proof protocol instances. See #3081 for additional details.</li> <li>A fix to an obscure bug includes a change to the data sent to the controller after publishing multiple, endorsed credential definition revocation registries in a single call. The bug fix was to properly process the publishing. The breaking change is that when the process (now successfully) completes, the controller is sent the list of published credential definitions. Previously only a single value was being sent. See PR #3107 for additional details.</li> <li>The configuration settings around whether a multitenant wallet uses a single database vs. a database per tenant has been made more explicit. The previous settings were not clear, resulting in some deployments that were intended to be a database per tenant actually result in all tenants being in the same database.

Importantly, this release completes the ACA-Py implementation of Aries Interop Profile v2.0, and enables the elimination of unqualified DIDs. While only deprecated for now, all deployments of ACA-Py SHOULD move to using only fully qualified DIDs as soon as possible.</p> <p>Much progress has been made on <code>did:peer</code> support in this release, with the handling of inbound DID Peer 1 added, and inbound and outbound support for DID Peer 2 and 4. Much attention was also paid to making sure that the Peer DID and DID Exchange capabilities match those of Credo-TS (formerly Aries Framework JavaScript). The completion of that work eliminates the remaining places where \"unqualified\" DIDs were being used, and to enable the \"connection reuse\" feature in the Out of Band protocol when using DID Peer 2 and 4 DIDs in invitations. See the document Qualified DIDs for details about how to control the use of DID Peer 2 or 4 in an ACA-Py deployment, and how to eliminate the use of unqualified DIDs. Support for DID Exchange v1.1 has been added to ACA-Py, with support for DID Exchange v1.0 retained, and we've added support for DID Rotation.</p> <p>Work continues towards supporting ledger agnostic AnonCreds, and the new Hyperledger AnonCreds Rust library. Some of that work is in this release, the rest will be in the next release.</p> <p>Attention was given in the release to simplifying the handling of JSON-LD Data Integrity Verifiable Credentials.</p> <p>An important change in this release is the re-organization of the ACA-Py documentation, moving the vast majority of the documents to the folders within the <code>docs</code> folder -- a long overdue change that will allow us to soon publish the documents on https://aca-py.org directly from the ACA-Py repository, rather than from the separate aries-acapy-docs currently being used.</p> <p>A big developer improvement is a revamping of the test handling to eliminate ~2500 warnings that were previously generated in the test suite.  Nice job @ff137!</p>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#0120-breaking-changes","title":"0.12.0 Breaking Changes","text":"<p>A deployment of this release that uses DID Peer 2 and 4 invitations may encounter problems interacting with agents deployed using older Aries protocols.

The vast majority (all?) Aries deployments have long since been updated to accept both values, so this change just forces the use of the newer value in sending messages. In updating this, we retained the old configuration parameters most deployments were using (<code>--emit-new-didcomm-prefix</code> and <code>--emit-new-didcomm-mime-type</code>) but updated the code to set the configuration parameters to <code>true</code> even if the parameters were not set. See [PR #2517].</p> <p>The JSON-LD verifiable credential handling of JSON-LD contexts has been updated to pre-load the base contexts into the repository code so they are not fetched at run time.

In previous releases, presentation exchange protocol state data records were retained in ACA-Py secure storage after the completion of protocol instances. With this release the default behavior changes to deleting those records by default, unless the <code>----preserve-exchange-records</code> flag is set in the configuration. This extends the use of that flag that previously applied only to issue credential records. The extension matches the initial intention of the flag--that it cover both issue credential and present proof exchanges. The \"best practices\" for ACA-Py is that the controller (business logic) store any long-lasting business information needed for the service that is using the Aries Agent, and ACA-Py storage should be used only for data necessary for the operation of the agent. In particular, protocol state data should be held in ACA-Py only as long as the protocol is running (as it is needed by ACA-Py), and once a protocol instance completes, the controller should extract and store the business information from the protocol state before it is deleted from ACA-Py storage.</p>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#0100-categorized-list-of-pull-requests","title":"0.10.0 Categorized List of Pull Requests","text":"<ul> <li>DIDComm Messaging Improvements/Fixes<ul> <li>fix: outbound send status missing on path #2393 dbluhm</li> <li>fix: keylist update response race condition #2391 dbluhm</li> </ul> </li> <li>DID Handling and Connection Establishment Updates/Fixes<ul> <li>fix: handle stored afgo and findy docs in corrections #2450 dbluhm</li> <li>chore: relax connections filter DID format #2451 chumbert</li> <li>fix: ignore duplicate record errors on add key #2447 dbluhm</li> <li>fix: ignore duplicate record errors on add key #2447 dbluhm</li> <li>fix: more diddoc corrections #2446 dbluhm</li> <li>feat: resolve connection targets and permit connecting via public DID #2409 dbluhm</li> <li>feat: add legacy peer did resolver #2404 dbluhm</li> <li>Fix: Ensure event/webhook is emitted for multi-use invitations #2413 esune</li> <li>feat: add DID Exchange specific problem reports and reject endpoint #2394 dbluhm</li> <li>fix: additional tweaks for did:web and other methods as public DIDs #2392 dbluhm</li> <li>Fix empty ServiceDecorator in OobRecord causing 422 Unprocessable Entity Error #2362 ff137</li> <li>Feat: Added support for Ed25519Signature2020 signature type and Ed25519VerificationKey2020 #2241 dkulic</li> </ul> </li> <li>Upgrading to Aries Askar Updates<ul> <li>Add symlink to /home/indy/.indy_client for backwards compatibility #2443 esune</li> </ul> </li> <li>Credential Exchange (Issue, Present) Updates<ul> <li>fix: ensure request matches offer in JSON-LD exchanges, if sent #2341 dbluhm</li> <li>BREAKING Extend --preserve-exchange-records to include Presentation Exchange. #2352 usingtechnology</li> <li>Correct the response type in send_rev_reg_def #2355 ff137</li> </ul> </li> <li>Multitenancy Updates and Fixes<ul> <li>Multitenant check endorser_info before saving #2395 usingtechnology</li> <li>Feat: Support Selectable Write Ledger #2339 shaangill025</li> </ul> </li> <li>Other Fixes, Demo, and Documentation Fixes<ul> <li>Redis Plugins [redis_cache &amp; redis_queue] documentation and docker related updates #1937 shaangill025</li> <li>Chore: fix marshmallow warnings #2398 ff137</li> <li>Upgrade pre-commit and flake8 dependencies; fix flake8 warnings #2399 ff137</li> <li>Corrected typo on mediator invitation configuration argument #2365 jorgefl0</li> <li>Add workaround for ARM based macs #2313 finnformica</li> </ul> </li> <li>Dependencies and Internal Updates<ul> <li>chore(deps): Bump certifi from 2023.5.7 to 2023.7.22 in /demo/playground/scripts dependencies #2354 dependabot bot</li> </ul> </li> <li>CI/CD and Developer Tools/Productivity Updates<ul> <li>Fix for nightly tests failing on Python 3.10 #2435 Gavinok</li> <li>Don't run Snyk on forks #2429 ryjones</li> <li>Issue #2250 Nightly publish workflow #2421 Gavinok</li> <li>Enable Snyk scanning #2418 ryjones</li> <li>Remove Indy tests from workflows #2415 dbluhm</li> </ul> </li> <li>Release management pull requests<ul> <li>0.10.1 #2454 swcurran</li> <li>0.10.0 #2452 swcurran</li> <li>0.10.0-rc2 #2448 swcurran</li> <li>0.10.0-rc1 #2442 swcurran</li> <li>0.10.0-rc0 #2414 swcurran</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#0100","title":"0.10.0","text":""},{"location":"CHANGELOG/#august-29-2023_1","title":"August 29, 2023","text":"<p>Release 0.10.1 has the same contents as 0.10.0.

We now recommend using those components (by using <code>--wallet-type askar</code> in the ACA-Py startup parameters) for new ACA-Py deployments. A wallet migration tool from indy-sdk storage to Askar storage is still needed before migrating existing deployment to Askar. A big thanks to those creating/reporting on stress test scenarios, and especially the team at LISSI for creating the aries-cloudagent-loadgenerator to make load testing so easy! And of course to the core ACA-Py team for addressing the findings.</p> <p>The largest enhancement is in the area of the endorsing of Hyperledger Indy ledger transactions, enabling an instance of ACA-Py to act as an Endorser for Indy authors needing endorsements to write objects to an Indy ledger. We're working on an Aries Endorser Service based on the new capabilities in ACA-Py, an Endorser to be easily operated by an organization, ideally with a controller starter kit supporting a basic human and automated approvals business workflow. Contributions welcome!</p> <p>A focus towards the end of the 0.7.4 development and release cycle was on the handling of AnonCreds revocation in ACA-Py. Most important, a production issue was uncovered where by an ACA-Py issuer's local Revocation Registry data could get out of sync with what was published on an Indy ledger, resulting in an inability to publish new RevRegEntry transactions -- making new revocations impossible. As a result, we have added some new endpoints to enable an update to the RevReg storage such that RevRegEntry transactions can again be published to the ledger. Other changes were added related to revocation in general and in the handling of tails files in particular.</p> <p>The team has worked a lot on evolving the persistent queue (PQ) approach available in ACA-Py. We have landed on a design for the queues for inbound and outbound messages using a default in-memory implementation, and the ability to replace the default method with implementations created via an ACA-Py plugin. There are two concrete, out-of-the-box external persistent queuing solutions available for Redis and Kafka. Those ACA-Py persistent queue implementation repositories will soon be migrated to the Aries project within the Hyperledger Foundation's GitHub organization. Anyone else can implement their own queuing plugin as long as it uses the same interface.</p> <p>Several new ways to control ACA-Py configurations were added, including new startup parameters, Admin API parameters to control instances of protocols, and additional web hook notifications.</p> <p>A number of fixes were made to the Credential Exchange protocols, both for V1 and V2, and for both AnonCreds and W3C format VCs. Nothing new was added and there no changes in the APIs.</p> <p>As well there were a number of internal fixes, dependency updates, documentation and demo changes, developer tools and release management updates.

The release also includes several new pieces of documentation (upgrade processing, storage database information and logging) and some other documentation updates that make the ACA-Py Read The Docs site useful again. And of course, some recent bug fixes and cleanups are included.</p> <p>There is a BREAKING CHANGE for those deploying ACA-Py with an external outbound queue implementation (see PR #1501). As far as we know, there is only one organization that has such an implementation and they were involved in the creation of this PR, so we are not making this release a minor or major update. However, anyone else using an external queue should be aware of the impact of this PR that is included in the release.</p> <p>For those that have an existing deployment of ACA-Py with long-lasting connection records, an upgrade is needed to use RFC 434 Out of Band and the \"reuse connection\" as the invitee. In PR #1453 (details below) a performance improvement was made when finding a connection for reuse. The new approach (adding a tag to the connection to enable searching) applies only to connections made using this ACA-Py release and later, and \"as-is\" connections made using earlier releases of ACA-Py will not be found as reuse candidates. A new \"Upgrade deployment\" capability (#1557, described below) must be executed to update your deployment to add tags for all existing connections.</p> <p>The Supported RFCs document has been updated to reflect the addition of the AIP 2.0 RFCs for which support was added.</p> <p>The following is an annotated list of PRs in the release, including a link to each PR.</p> <ul> <li>AIP 2.0 Features<ul> <li>Discover Features Protocol: v1_0 refactoring and v2_0 implementation #1500</li> <li>Updates the Discover Features 1.0 (AIP 1.0) implementation and implements the new 2.0 version.

When executed (via a command line option), a current version of the deployment is detected and if any storage updates need be applied to be consistent with the new version, they are, and the stored \"current version\"is updated to the new version.

The tag name and title of the release should be the same as the    version in pyproject.toml.

It will only be applied to the highest non-RC semantic version. For    example, if version <code>0.12.5</code> is released after <code>1.3.0</code>, the <code>latest</code> tag will    remain on <code>1.3.0</code> because <code>1.3.0 &gt; 0.12.5</code> in semantic version ordering.</p> <p>LTS (Long Term Support) Releases:</p> <p>LTS versions receive additional tags (e.g., <code>py3.12-0.12-lts</code>) that move to the    latest patch release in that LTS line.

If you just highlight and copy the JWT, you don\u2019t get the prefix.</li> <li>Click on \u201cAbout\u201d from the left menu and then click \u201cTraction.\u201d</li> <li>Click on the link with the \u201cSwagger URL\u201d label to open up the OpenAPI (Swagger) API.</li> <li>The URL is just the normal Traction Tenant API with `\u201dapi/doc\u201d added to it.</li> <li>Click Authorize in the top right, click in the second box \u201cAuthorizationHeader (apiKey)\u201d and paste in your previously copied encoded JWT.</li> <li>Close the authorization window and try out an Endpoint. For example, scroll down to the \u201cGET /connections\u201d endpoint, \u201cTry It Out\u201d and \u201cExecute\u201d.  You should get back a list of the connections you have established in your Tenant.</li> </ul> <p>The ACA-Py/Traction API is pretty large, but it is reasonably well organized, and you should recognize from the Traction API a lot of the items. Try some of the \u201cGET\u201d endpoints to see if you recognize the items.</p> <p>We\u2019re still working on a good demo for the OpenAPI from Traction, but this one from ACA-Py is a good outline of the process. It doesn't use your Traction Tenant, but you should get the idea about the sequence of calls to make to accomplish Aries-type activities. For example, see if you can carry out the steps to do the Lab 4 with your mobile agent by invoking the right sequence of OpenAPI calls.</p>"},{"location":"demo/ACA-Py-Workshop/#whats-next-experiment-with-an-issuer-web-app","title":"What's Next: Experiment With an Issuer Web App","text":"<p>If you are challenged to use Traction or ACA-Py to become an issuer, you will likely be building API calls into your Line of Business web application.

This is something you couldn't do a with the older RFC 0160 Connection Protocol that we used in the early days of Aries. It was a pain, and made for a lousy user experience, as on every visit to an existing contact, the invitee got a new connection.</p> <p>The requirements on your invitations (such as in the example below) are:</p> <ul> <li>The invitation <code>services</code> item MUST be a resolvable DID.</li> <li>Or alternatively, the invitation <code>services</code> item MUST NOT be an <code>inline</code> service.</li> <li>The DID in the invitation <code>services</code> item is the same one in every invitation.</li> </ul> <p>Example invitation:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"@type\": \"https://didcomm.org/out-of-band/1.1/invitation\",\n    \"@id\": \"77489d63-caff-41fe-a4c1-ec7e2ff00695\",\n    \"label\": \"faber.agent\",\n    \"handshake_protocols\": [\n        \"https://didcomm.org/didexchange/1.0\"\n    ],\n    \"services\": [\n        \"did:peer:2.4JiUsoK85pVkkB1bAPzFaP4JiUsoK85pVkkB1bAPzFaP\"\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here's the flow that demonstrates where reuse helps. For simplicity, we'll use the terms \"Issuer\" and \"Wallet\" in this example, but it applies to any connection between any two agents (the inviter and the invitee) that establish connections with one another.</p> <ul> <li>The Wallet user is using a browser on the Issuers website and gets to the   point where they are going to be offered a credential. As part of that flow,   they are presented with a QR code that they scan with their wallet app.</li> <li>The QR contains an RFC 0434 Out of Band invitation to connect that the   Wallet processes as the invitee.</li> <li>The Wallet uses the information in the invitation to send an RFC 0023 DID Exchange request   DIDComm message back to the Issuer to initiate establishing a connection.</li> <li>The Issuer responds back to the <code>request</code> with a <code>response</code> message, and the   connection is established.</li> <li>Later, the Wallet user returns to the Issuer's website, and does something   (perhaps starts the process to get another credential) that results in the   same QR code being displayed, and again the users scans the QR code with their   Wallet app.</li> <li>The Wallet recognizes (based on the DID in the <code>services</code> item in the   invitation -- see example below) that it already has a connection to the   Issuer, so instead of sending a DID Exchange <code>request</code> message back to the   Issuer, they send an RFC 0434 Out of Band reuse DIDComm message, and both   parties know to use the existing connection.</li> <li>Had the Wallet used the DID Exchange <code>request</code> message, a new connection     would have been established.</li> </ul> <p>The RFC 0434 Out of Band protocol requirement enables <code>reuse</code> message by the invitee (the Wallet in the flow above) is that the <code>service</code> in the invitation MUST be a resolvable DID that is the same in all of the invitations. In the example invitation above, the DID is a <code>did:peer</code> DID that is resolvable without requiring a public ledger. The DID could also be a Peer DID of types 2 or 4, which encode the entire DIDDoc contents into the DID identifier (thus they are \"resolvable DIDs\"). What cannot be used is either the old \"unqualified\" DIDs that were commonly used in Aries prior to 2024, and Peer DID type 1. Both of those have DID types include both an identifier and a DIDDoc in the <code>services</code> item of the Out of Band invitation. As noted in the Out of Band specification, <code>reuse</code> cannot be used with such DID types even if the contents are the same.</p> <p>Example invitation:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"@type\": \"https://didcomm.org/out-of-band/1.1/invitation\",\n    \"@id\": \"77489d63-caff-41fe-a4c1-ec7e2ff00695\",\n    \"label\": \"faber.agent\",\n    \"handshake_protocols\": [\n        \"https://didcomm.org/didexchange/1.0\"\n    ],\n    \"services\": [\n        \"did:peer:2.4JiUsoK85pVkkB1bAPzFaP4JiUsoK85pVkkB1bAPzFaP\"\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The use of connection reuse can be demonstrated with the Alice / Faber demos as follows. We assume you have already somewhat familiar with your options for running the Alice Faber Demo (e.g. locally or in a browser). Follow those instruction up to the point where you are about to start the Faber and Alice agents.</p> <ol> <li>On a command line, run Faber with these parameters: <code>./run_demo faber    --reuse-connections --public-did-connections --events</code>.</li> <li>On a second command line, run Alice as normal, perhaps with the <code>events</code>    option: <code>./run_demo alice --reuse-connections --events</code></li> <li>Copy the invitation from the Faber terminal and paste it into the Alice    terminal at the prompt.</li> <li>Verify that the connection was established.</li> <li>If you want, go to the Alice OpenAPI screen (port <code>8031</code>, path       <code>api/docs</code>), and then use the <code>GET Connections</code> to see that Alice has one       connection to Faber.</li> <li>In the Faber terminal, type <code>4</code> to get a prompt for a new connection. This    will generate a new invitation with the same public DID.</li> <li>In the Alice terminal, type <code>4</code> to get a prompt for a new connection, and    paste the new invitation.</li> <li>Note from the webhook events in the Faber terminal that the <code>reuse</code> message    is received from Alice, and as a result, no new connection was created.</li> <li>Execute again the <code>GET Connections</code> endpoint on the Alice OpenAPI screen       to confirm that there is still just one established connection.</li> <li>Try running the demo again without the <code>--reuse-connections</code> parameter and    compare the <code>services</code> value in the new invitation vs. what was generated in    Steps 3 and 7. It is not a DID, but rather a one time use, inline DIDDoc    item.</li> </ol> <p>While in the demo Faber uses in the invitation the same DID they publish as an issuer (and uses in creating the schema and Cred Def for the demo), Faber could use any resolvable (not inline) DID, including DID Peer types 2 or 4 DIDs, as long as the DID is the same in every invitation. It is the fact that the DID is always the same that tells the invitee that they can reuse an existing connection.</p> <p>For example, to run faber with connection reuse using a non-public DID:</p> <pre><code>./run_demo faber --reuse-connections --events\n</code></pre> <p>To run faber using a <code>did:peer</code> and reusable connections:</p> <pre><code>./run_demo faber --reuse-connections --emit-did-peer-2 --events\n</code></pre> <p>To run this demo using a multi-use invitation (from Faber):</p> <pre><code>./run_demo faber --reuse-connections --emit-did-peer-2 --multi-use-invitations --events\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"demo/WebVH-Workshop/","title":"WebVH and AnonCreds Workshop Using Traction Sandbox","text":""},{"location":"demo/WebVH-Workshop/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Welcome!

This will create a revocation registry that allows you to revoke credentials if needed.</li> <li>Revocation Registry Size: Set this to <code>4</code>. This determines the maximum number of credentials that can be revoked in this registry. For this workshop, a small registry size is sufficient.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Click \"Submit\" and wait for the operation to complete.</li> <li>The Credential Definition will be:<ul> <li>Created with your WebVH DID as the issuer</li> <li>Linked to your schema</li> <li>Created with a revocation registry (size 4) for revocable credentials</li> <li>Signed and published as an Attested Resource on the WebVH server</li> </ul> </li> <li>Click the \"Refresh\" button if needed to see the Create icon has been replaced with the identifier for your CredDef.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Review your AnonCreds objects:<ol> <li>Move to the menu item \"Configuration \u2192 Credential Definition Storage\" to see    the CredDef you created. If you want, expand it to view the raw data.</li> <li>Both your Schema and Credential Definition are now published on the WebVH server    and can be resolved using your WebVH DID. Unlike blockchain-based registries,    these objects are accessible via HTTP resolution of your DID.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Browse your resources in the WebVH Explorer:<ol> <li>The WebVH server provides a web-based explorer interface that allows you to    browse and view all DIDs, resources, and credentials published on the server.</li> <li>Open your web browser and navigate to the WebVH Explorer. For the sandbox server,    the URL is: <code>https://sandbox.bcvh.vonx.io/explorer</code>.</li> <li>In the explorer interface, you can:<ul> <li>View DIDs: Click on \"DIDs\" or navigate to the DIDs section to see all published DIDs.   You can filter by namespace (e.g., <code>default</code>) or by the SCID value to find your DID.</li> <li>View Resources: Click on \"Resources\" to see all published AnonCreds resources   (schemas, credential definitions, revocation registries). Your schema and credential   definition should appear in this list.</li> <li>Search: Use the search/filter functionality to find your specific resources by:</li> <li>Your DID identifier</li> <li>Resource type (e.g., \"anonCredsSchema\" or \"anonCredsCredDef\")</li> <li>Namespace</li> </ul> </li> <li>Click on your schema or credential definition in the explorer to view its details:<ul> <li>The full resource content</li> <li>The resource metadata</li> <li>The cryptographic proof (Data Integrity Proof)</li> <li>The resource ID (which matches the schema ID or credential definition ID you saw in Traction)</li> </ul> </li> <li>This demonstrates that your AnonCreds objects are publicly accessible and can be    discovered and resolved by anyone who knows your DID or the resource ID.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>Completed all the steps? Great! Feel free to create a second Schema and Cred Def, ideally one related to your first. That way you can try out a presentation request that pulls data from both credentials! When you create the second schema, use the \"Create Schema\" button, and add the claims you want to have in your new type of credential.</p>"},{"location":"demo/WebVH-Workshop/#lab-4-issuing-credentials-to-a-mobile-wallet","title":"Lab 4: Issuing Credentials to a Mobile Wallet","text":"<p>In this lab we will use our Traction Tenant agent to issue instances of the credentials we created in Lab 3 to our Mobile Wallet we downloaded in Lab 1.</p>"},{"location":"demo/WebVH-Workshop/#lab-4-steps-to-follow","title":"Lab 4: Steps to Follow","text":"<ol> <li>If necessary, log into your Traction Sandbox with your Wallet ID and Key.</li> <li>Issue a Credential:<ol> <li>Click the menu item \"Issuance\" and then \"Offer a Credential\".</li> <li>Select the Credential Definition of the credential you want to issue (the one you created in Lab 3).</li> <li>Select the Contact Name to whom you are issuing the credential\u2014the alias of the connection you made to your mobile Wallet.</li> <li>Click the \"Enter Credential Value\" to popup a data entry form for the attributes to populate.<ol> <li>When you enter the date values that you want to use in predicates    (e.g., \"Older than 19\"), put the date into the following format:    <code>YYYYMMDD</code>, e.g., <code>20231001</code>.

If you just highlight and copy the JWT, you don't get the prefix.</li> <li>Click on \"About\" from the left menu and then click \"Traction.\"</li> <li>Click on the link with the \"Swagger URL\" label to open up the OpenAPI (Swagger) API.</li> <li>The URL is just the normal Traction Tenant API with `\"api/doc\" added to it.</li> <li>Click Authorize in the top right, click in the second box \"AuthorizationHeader (apiKey)\" and paste in your previously copied encoded JWT.</li> <li>Close the authorization window and try out an Endpoint. For example, scroll down to the \"GET /connections\" endpoint, \"Try It Out\" and \"Execute\".  You should get back a list of the connections you have established in your Tenant.</li> </ul> <p>The ACA-Py/Traction API is pretty large, but it is reasonably well organized, and you should recognize from the Traction API a lot of the items. Try some of the \"GET\" endpoints to see if you recognize the items. You can also explore the WebVH-specific endpoints:</p> <ul> <li><code>GET /did/webvh/configuration</code> - Get your WebVH configuration</li> <li><code>POST /did/webvh/create</code> - Create a new WebVH DID</li> <li><code>GET /anoncreds/registries</code> - List available AnonCreds registries (should include WebVH)</li> </ul> <p>We're still working on a good demo for the OpenAPI from Traction, but this one from ACA-Py is a good outline of the process.

In such a deployment there are always two components - a configured agent itself, and a controller that injects into that agent the business rules for the particular agent instance (see diagram).</p> <p></p> <p>The deployed agent messages with other agents via DIDComm protocols, and as events associated with those messages occur, sends webhook HTTP notifications to the controller. The agent also exposes for the controller's exclusive use an HTTP API covering all of the administrative handlers for those events. The controller receives the notifications from the agent, decides (with business rules - possible by asking a person using a UI) how to respond to the event and calls back to the agent via the HTTP API. Of course, the controller may also initiate events (e.g. messaging another agent) by calling that same API.</p> <p>The following is an example of the interactions involved in creating a connection using the DIDComm \"Establish Connection\" protocol. The controller requests from the agent (via the administrative API) a connection invitation from the agent, and receives one back. The controller provides it to another agent (perhaps by displaying it in a QR code). Shortly after, the agent receives a DIDComm \"Connection Request\" message. The agent, sends it to the controller. The controller decides to accept the connection and calls the API with instructions to the agent to send a \"Connection Response\" message to the other agent. Since the controller always wants to know with whom a connection has been created, the controller also sends instructions to the agent (via the API, of course) to send a request presentation message to the new connection. And so on... During the interactions, the agent is tracking the state of the connections, and the state of the protocol instances (threads). Likewise, the controller may also be retaining state - after all, it's an application that could do anything.</p> <p>Most developers will configure a \"black box\" instance of the ACA-Py. They need to know how it works, the DIDComm protocols it supports, the events it will generate and the administrative API it exposes. However, they don't need to drill into and maintain the ACA-Py code. Such developers will build controller applications (basically, traditional web apps) that at their simplest, use an HTTP interface to receive notification and send HTTP requests to the agent. It's the business logic implemented in, or accessed by the controller that gives the deployment its personality and role.</p> <p>Note: the ACA-Py agent is designed to be stateless, persisting connection and protocol state to storage (such as Postgres database). As such, agents can be deployed to support horizontal scaling as necessary. Controllers can also be implemented to support horizontal scaling.</p> <p>The sections below detail the internals of the ACA-Py and it's configurable elements, and the conceptual elements of a controller. There is no \"Aries controller\" repo to fork, as it is essentially just a web app. There are demos of using the elements in this repo, and several sample applications that you can use to get started on your on controller.</p>"},{"location":"deploying/deploymentModel/#aca-py","title":"ACA-Py","text":"<p>ACA-Py implement services to manage the execution of DIDComm messaging protocols for interacting with other DIDComm agents, and exposes an administrative HTTP API that supports a controller to direct how the agent should respond to messaging events. The agent relies on the controller to provide the business rules for handling the messaging events, and to initiate the execution of new DIDComm protocol instances. The internals of an ACA-Py instance is diagramed below.</p> <p></p> <p>Instances of the ACA-Py agents are configured with the following sub-components:</p> <ul> <li>Transport Plugins - pluggable transport-specific message sender/receiver modules that interact with other agents. Messages outside the plugins are transport-agnostic JSON structures. Current modules include HTTP and WebSockets. In the future, we might add ZMQ, SMTP and so on.</li> <li>Conductor receives inbound messages from, and sends outbound messages to, the transport plugins. After internal processing, the conductor passes inbound messages to, and receives outbound messages from, the Dispatcher. In processing the messages, the conductor manages the message\u2019s protocol instance thread state, retrieving the state on inbound messages and saving the state on outbound messages. The conductor handles generic decorators in messages such as verifying and generating signatures on message data elements, internationalization and so on.</li> <li>Dispatcher handles the distribution of messages to the DIDComm protocol message handlers and the responses received. The dispatcher passes to the conductor the thread state to be persistance and message data (if any) to be sent out from the ACA-Py agent instance.</li> <li>DIDComm Protocols - implement the DIDComm protocols supported by the agent instance, including the state object for the protocol, the DIDComm message handlers and the admin message handlers. Protocols are bundled as Python modules and loaded for during the agent deployment. Each protocol contributes the admin messages for the protocol to the controller REST interface. The protocols implement a number of events that invoke the controller via webhooks so that controller\u2019s business logic can respond to the event.</li> <li>Controller REST API - a dynamically generated REST API (with a Swagger/OpenAPI user interface) based on the set of DIDComm protocols included in the agent deployment. The controller, activated via the webhooks from the protocol DIDComm message handlers, controls the ACA-Py agent by calling the REST API that invoke the protocol admin message handlers.</li> <li>Handler API - provides abstract interfaces to various handlers needed by the protocols and core ACA-Py agent components for accessing the secure storage (wallet), other storage, the ledger and so on. The API calls the handler implementations configured into the agent deployment.</li> <li>Handler Plugins - are the handler implementations called from the Handler API. The plugins may be internal to the Agent (in the same process space) or could be external (for example, in other processes/containers).</li> <li>Secure Storage Plugin - Askar is used by the ACA-Py agent to implement secure storage. An ACA-Py agent can be configured to use a supported storage backend such as in-memory, SQLite, or Postgres at this time.</li> <li>Ledger Interface Plugin - The ACA-Py agent provides an interface to an Indy-based public ledger for verifiable credential protocols. In future, ledger implementations (including those other than Indy) might be moved into the DIDComm protocol modules to be included as needed within a configured ACA-Py agent instance based on the DIDComm protocols used by the agent.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"deploying/deploymentModel/#controller","title":"Controller","text":"<p>A controller provides the personality of ACA-Py agent instance - the business logic (human, machine or rules driven) that drive the behaviour of the agent.

The initiator invokes the REST API exposed by the ACA-Py agent to initiate the creation of a DIDComm protocol instance. For example, a permit-issuing service uses this mechanism to issue a Verifiable Credential associated with the issuance of a new permit.</li> <li>Responder - subscribes to and responds to events from the ACA-Py agent protocol message handlers, providing business-driven responses. The responder might respond immediately, or the event might cause a delay while the decision is determined, perhaps by sending the request to a person to decide. The controller may persist the event response state if the event is asynchronous - for example, when the event is passed to a person who may respond when they next use the web app.</li> <li>Configuration - manages the controller configuration data and the configuration of the ACA-Py agent.  Configuration in this context includes things like:</li> <li>Credentials and Proof Requests to be Issued/Verified (respectively) by the ACA-Py agent.</li> <li>The configuration of the webhook handler to which the responder subscribes.</li> </ul> <p>While there are several examples of controllers, there is no \u201ccookie cutter\u201d repository to fork and customize. A controller is just a web service that receives HTTP requests (webhooks) and sends HTTP messages to the ACA-Py agent it controls via the REST API exposed by that agent.</p>"},{"location":"deploying/deploymentModel/#deployment","title":"Deployment","text":"<p>The ACA-Py agent CI pipeline configured into the repository generates a PyPi package as an artifact. Implementers will generally have a controller repository, possibly copied from an existing controller instance, that has the code (business logic) for the controller and the configuration (transports, handlers, DIDComm protocols, etc.) for the ACA-Py agent instance. In the most common scenario, the ACA-Py agent and controller instances will be deployed based on the artifacts (e.g. container images) generated from that controller repository. With the simple HTTP-based interface between the controller and ACA-Py agent, both components can be horizontally scaled as needed, with a load balancer between the components. The configuration of the ACA-Py agent to use the Postgres wallet supports enterprise scale agent deployments.</p> <p>Current examples of deployed instances of ACA-Py agent and controllers include:</p> <ul> <li>indy-email-verification - a web app Controller that sends an email to a given email address with an embedded DIDComm invitation and on establishment of a connection, offers and provides the connected agent with an email control verifiable credential.</li> <li>iiwbook - a web app Controller that on creation of a DIDComm connection, requests a proof of email control, and then sends to the connection a verifiable credential proving attendance at IIW. In between the proof and issuance is a human approval step using a simple web-based UI that implements a request queue.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"deploying/upgradingToAipv2/","title":"Upgrading Your Controller to AIP 2.0","text":"<p>This guide helps you upgrade your controller application to use AIP 2.0 endpoints and features when working with ACA-Py.</p>"},{"location":"deploying/upgradingToAipv2/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>AIP 2.0 introduces significant changes to how credential and presentation exchanges are handled.

This new component offers support for multiple enterprise-grade database providers, including cloud-based solutions. It also leverages cloud-native encryption capabilities, providing flexibility with options for encryption at rest and field-level encryption that can be turned on or off based on specific security requirements.</p> <p>By relying on proven, built-in encryption mechanisms provided by various database and cloud platforms, this approach simplifies the overall architecture, reducing the need for custom encryption logic at the application layer. It also maximizes the benefits of vendor-provided encryption technologies, ensuring \"best-of-breed\" encryption tailored to each database provider.</p> <p>This enhancement also prepares the ACA-Py system for quantum-proof encryption by allowing different vendors to implement solutions aligned with their specific quantum-resistant technologies.

This is to keep a clear hierarchical difference between base and sub wallets.

The default is to have each tenant in a separate wallet. This is done to keep the wallets separate and to allow for more flexibility in the future. If you want to have all tenants in a single wallet you can set the <code>multitenancy-config</code> with the value <code>{\"wallet_type\": \"single-wallet-askar\"}</code>. If you want to explicitly set the wallet type for each tenant you can do so by setting the <code>multitenancy-config</code> with the value <code>{\"wallet_type\": \"basic\"}</code>. See .vscode-sample/multitenant-admin.yml for an example.</p> <pre><code>## Multi-tenant Admin API\n\nThe multi-tenant admin API allows you to manage wallets in ACA-Py. Only the base wallet can manage wallets, so you can't for example create a wallet in the context of sub wallet (using the `Authorization` header as specified in [Authentication](#authentication)).\n\nMulti-tenancy related actions are grouped under the `/multitenancy` path or the `multitenancy` topic in the SwaggerUI. As mentioned above, the multi-tenant admin API is disabled by default, event when multi-tenancy is enabled. This is to allow for more flexible agent configuration (e.g. horizontal scaling where only a single instance exposes the admin API). To enable the multi-tenant admin API, the `--multitenant-admin` startup parameter can be used.\n\nSee the SwaggerUI for the exact API definition for multi-tenancy.\n\n## Managed vs Unmanaged Mode\n\nMulti-tenancy in ACA-Py is designed with two key management modes in mind.\n\n### Managed Mode\n\nIn **`managed`** mode, ACA-Py will manage the key for the wallet. This is the easiest configuration as it allows ACA-Py to fully control the wallet. When a message is received from another agent it can immediately unlock the wallet and process the message. The wallet key is stored encrypted in the base wallet.\n\n### Unmanaged Mode\n\nIn **`unmanaged`** mode, ACA-Py won't manage the key for the wallet. The key is not stored in the base wallet, which means the key to unlock the wallet needs to be provided whenever the wallet is used. When a message from another agent is received, ACA-Py cannot immediately unlock the wallet and process the message. See [Authentication](#authentication) for more info.\n\nIt is important to note unmanaged mode doesn't provide a lot of security over managed mode. The key is still processed by the agent, and therefore trust is required. It could however provide some benefit in the case a multi-tenant agent is compromised, as the agent doesn't store the key to unlock the wallet.\n\n&gt; :warning: Although support for unmanaged mode is mostly in place, the receiving of messages from other agents in unmanaged mode is not supported yet. This means unmanaged mode can not be used yet.\n\n### Mode Usage\n\nThe mode used can be specified when creating a wallet using the `key_management_mode` parameter.\n\n```jsonc\n// POST /multitenancy/wallet\n{\n  // ... other params ...\n  \"key_management_mode\": \"managed\" // or \"unmanaged\"\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"features/Multitenancy/#message-routing","title":"Message Routing","text":"<p>In multi-tenant mode, when ACA-Py receives a message from another agent, it will need to determine which tenant to route the message to.

This means it can't route messages to sub wallets based on the endpoint. To resolve this the base wallet acts as a relay for all sub wallets. As can be seen in the architecture diagram above, all messages go through the base wallet. whenever a sub wallet creates a new key or connection, it will be registered at the base wallet. This allows the base wallet to look at the recipient keys for a message and determine which wallet it needs to route to.</p>"},{"location":"features/Multitenancy/#mediation","title":"Mediation","text":"<p>ACA-Py allows messages to be routed through a mediator, and multi-tenancy can be used in combination with external mediators.

Option 2. gives more control over the mediator being used. This could be useful if e.g. all wallets use a different mediator.</p> <p>A combination of option 1. and 2. is also possible.

However, it is often desirable to produce native language interfaces rather than coding <code>Controllers</code> using HTTP primitives. This is possible using several public code generation (codegen) tools. This page provides some suggestions based on experience with these tools when trying to generate <code>Typescript</code> wrappers. The information should be useful to those trying to generate other languages. Updates to this page based on experience are encouraged.</p>"},{"location":"features/UsingOpenAPI/#aca-py-openapi-raw-output-characteristics","title":"ACA-Py, OpenAPI Raw Output Characteristics","text":"<p>ACA-Py uses aiohttp_apispec tags in code to produce the OpenAPI spec file at runtime dependent on what features have been loaded. How these tags are created is documented in the API Standard Behavior section of the Admin API Readme. The OpenAPI spec is available in raw, unformatted form from a running ACA-Py instance using a route of <code>http://&lt;acapy host and port&gt;/api/docs/swagger.json</code> or from the browser <code>Swagger User Interface</code> directly.</p> <p>The ACA-Py Admin API evolves across releases. To track these changes and ensure conformance with the OpenAPI specification, we provide a tool located at <code>scripts/generate-open-api-spec</code>. This tool starts ACA-Py, retrieves the <code>swagger.json</code> file, and runs codegen tools to generate specifications in both Swagger and OpenAPI formats with <code>json</code> language output. The output of this tool enables comparison with the checked-in <code>open-api/swagger.json</code> and <code>open-api/openapi.json</code>, and also serves as a useful resource for identifying any non-conformance to the OpenAPI specification. At the moment, <code>validation</code> is turned off via the <code>open-api/openAPIJSON.config</code> file, so warning messages are printed for non-conformance, but the <code>json</code> is still output. Most of the warnings reported by <code>generate-open-api-spec</code> relate to missing <code>operationId</code> fields which results in manufactured method names being created by codegen tools. At the moment, aiohttp_apispec does not support adding <code>operationId</code> annotations via tags.</p> <p>The <code>generate-open-api-spec</code> tool was initially created to help identify issues with method parameters not being sorted, resulting in somewhat random ordering each time a codegen operation was performed. This is relevant for languages which do not have support for named parameters such as <code>Javascript</code>. It is recommended that the <code>generate-open-api-spec</code> is run prior to each release, and the resulting <code>open-api/openapi.json</code> file checked in to allow tracking of API changes over time. At the moment, this process is not automated as part of the release pipeline.</p>"},{"location":"features/UsingOpenAPI/#generating-language-wrappers-for-aca-py","title":"Generating Language Wrappers for ACA-Py","text":"<p>There are inevitably differences around <code>best practice</code> for method naming based on coding language and organization standards.</p> <p>Best practice for generating ACA-Py language wrappers is to obtain the raw OpenAPI file from a configured/running ACA-Py instance and then post-process it with a merge utility to match routes and insert desired <code>operationId</code> fields. This allows the greatest flexibility in conforming to external naming requirements.</p> <p>Two major open-source code generation tools are Swagger and OpenAPI Tools. Which of these to use can be very dependent on language support required and preference for the style of code generated.</p> <p>The OpenAPI Tools was found to offer some nice features when generating <code>Typescript</code>. It creates separate files for each class and allows the use of a <code>.openapi-generator-ignore</code> file to override generation if there is a spec file issue that needs to be maintained manually.</p> <p>If generating code for languages that do not support named parameters, it is recommended to specify the <code>useSingleRequestParameter</code> or equivalent in your code generator of choice. The reason is that, as mentioned previously, there have been instances where parameters were not sorted when output into the raw ACA-Py API spec file, and this approach helps remove that risk.</p> <p>Another suggestion for code generation is to keep the <code>modelPropertyNaming</code> set to <code>original</code> when generating code. Although it is tempting to try and enable marshalling into standard naming formats such as <code>camelCase</code>, the reality is that the models represent what is sent on the wire and documented in the Aries Protocol RFCS. It has proven handy to be able to see code references correspond directly with protocol RFCs when debugging. It will also correspond directly with what the <code>model</code> shows when looking at the ACA-Py <code>Swagger UI</code> in a browser if you need to try something out manually before coding.

An instance of an ACA-Py agent is actually made up of to two parts - the agent itself and a controller.</p> <p></p> <p>The agent handles all of the core Aries/non-Aries functionality such as interacting with other agents, managing secure storage, sending event notifications to, and receiving directions from, the controller. The controller provides the business logic that defines how that particular agent instance behaves--how to respond to events in the agent, and when to trigger the agent to initiate events. The controller might be a web or native user interface for a person or it might be coded business rules driven by an enterprise system.</p> <p>Between the two is a simple interface. The agent sends event notifications to the controller and the controller sends administrator messages to the agent. The controller registers a webhook with the agent, and the event notifications are HTTP callbacks, and the agent exposes a REST API to the controller for all of the administrative messages it is configured to handle. Each of the DIDComm protocols supported by the agent adds a set of administrative messages for the controller to use in responding to events. The Aries cloud agent includes an OpenAPI (aka Swagger) user interface for a developer to use to explore the API for a specific agent.</p> <p>As such, the agent is just a configured dependency in an ACA-Py deployment. Thus, the vast majority of ACA-Py developers will focus on building controllers (business logic) and perhaps some custom plugins (protocols, as we'll discuss soon) for the agent. Only a relatively small group of ACA-Py maintainers will focus on adding and maintaining the agent dependency.</p> <p>Want more details about the agent and controller internals?

Sigh...). A significant emerging use case missing from that picture are agents embedded within/associated with IoT devices. In the common IoT case, IoT device agents are just variants of other edge agents, connected to the rest of the ecosystem through a cloud agent. All the same principles apply.</p> <p>Misleading in the picture is that (almost) all agents connect directly to the verifiable data repository. In this picture it's the Sovrin ledger, but that could be any ledger (e.g. set of nodes running ledger software) or non-ledger based verifiable data repositories -- such as web servers. That implies most agents embed a verifiable data registry client (usually, a DID Resolver) that makes calls to one or more types of verifiable data registries. Thus, unlike what is implied in the picture, edge agents (commonly) do not call a cloud agent to interact with the verifiable data registry - they do it directly. Super small IoT devices might be an exception to that - lacking compute/storage resources and/or connectivity, they might communicate with a cloud agent that would communicate with the verifiable data registry.</p> <p>The three most common purposes of cloud agents are verifiable credential issuers, verifiers and \"mediators\" -- agents that route messages to mobile wallets that lack a persistent endpoint. For the latter, rather than messages going directly to mobile wallet (which is often impossible - for example sending to a mobile wallet), messages intended for the agent are routed through a mediator who hold the messages until the agent picks up its messages.</p> <p>We also recommend not digging into all the layers described here.

This is true in AnonCreds, particularly in the management of AnonCreds revocation registries (RevRegs). Through experience in deploying use cases with ACA-Py we have found that it is very difficult for the controller (the application code) to manage revocation registries, and as such, we have changed the implementation in ACA-Py to ensure that it is handling almost all the work in revoking credentials. The only thing the controller writer has to do is track the minimum things necessary to the business rules around revocation, such as whose credentials should be revoked, and how close to real-time should revocations be published?</p> <p>Here is a summary of all of the AnonCreds revocation activities performed by issuers. After this, we'll provide a (much shorter) list of what an ACA-Py issuer controller has to do. For those interested, there is a more complete overview of AnonCreds revocation, including all of the roles, and some details of the cryptography behind the approach:</p> <ul> <li>Issuers indicate that a credential will support revocation when creating the   credential definition (CredDef).</li> <li>Issuers create a Revocation Registry definition object of a given size   (MaxSize -- the number of credentials that can use the RevReg) and publish it   to the ledger (or more precisely, the verifiable data registry). In doing   that, a Tails file is also created and published somewhere on the Internet,   accessible to all Holders.</li> <li>Issuers create and publish an initial Revocation Registry Entry that defines   the state of all credentials within the RevReg, either all active or all   revoked. It's a really bad idea to create a RevReg starting with \"all   revoked\", so don't do that.</li> <li>Issuers issue credentials and note the \"revocation ID\" of each credential. The   \"revocation Id\" is a compound key consisting of the RevRegId from which the   credential was issued, and the index within that registry of that credential.   An index (from 1 to Max Size of the registry -- or perhaps 0 to Max Size - 1)   can only be associated with one issued credential.</li> <li>At some point, a RevReg is all used up (full), and the Issuer must create another   one. Ideally, this does not cause an extra delay in the process of issuing credentials.</li> <li>At some point, the Issuer revokes the credential of a holder, using the   revocation Id of the relevant credential.</li> <li>At some point, either in conjunction with each revocation, or for a batch of   revocations, the Issuer publishes the RevReg(s) associated with a CredDef to   the ledger. If there are multiple revocations spread across multiple RevRegs,   there may be multiple writes to the ledger.</li> </ul> <p>Since managing RevRegs is really hard for an ACA-Py controller, we have tried to minimize what an ACA-Py Issuer controller has to do, leaving everything else to be handled by ACA-Py. Of the items in the previous list, here is what an ACA-Py issuer controller does:</p> <ul> <li>Issuers flag that revocation will be used when creating the CredDef and the   desired size of the RevReg. ACA-Py takes case of creating the initial   RevReg(s) without further action by the controller.</li> <li>Two RevRegs are initially created, so there is no delay when one fills up,     and another is needed. In ongoing operations, when one RevReg fills up, the     other active RevReg is used, and a new RevReg is created.</li> <li>On creation of each RevReg, its corresponding tails file is published by     ACA-Py.</li> <li>On Issuance, the controller receives the logical \u201crevocation ID\" (combination   of RevRegId+Index) of the issued credential to track.</li> <li>On Revocation, the controller passes in the logical \u201crevocation ID\" of the   credential to be revoked, including a \u201cnotify holder\u201d flag. ACA-Py records the   revocation as pending and, if asked, sends a notification to the holder using   a DIDComm message (Aries RFC 0183: Revocation Notification).</li> <li>The Issuer requests that the revocations for a CredDefId be published. ACA-Py   figures out what RevRegs contain pending revocation and so need to be   published, and publishes each.</li> </ul> <p>That is the minimum amount of tracking the controller must do while still being able to execute the business rules around revoking credentials.</p> <p>From experience, we\u2019ve added to two extra features to deal with unexpected conditions:</p> <ul> <li>When using an Indy (or similar) ledger, if the local copy of a RevReg gets out   of sync with the ledger copy (perhaps due to a failed ledger write), the   Framework can create an update transaction to \u201cfix\u201d the issue. This is needed   for a revocation state using deltas-type solution (like Indy), but not for a   ledger that publishes revocation states containing the entire state of each   credential.</li> <li>From time to time there may be a need to \u201crotate\u201d a   RevReg \u2014 to mark existing, active RevRegs as   \u201cdecommissioned\u201d, and create new ones in their place.

DIDComm enables secure, asynchronous, end-to-end encrypted messaging between agents, with messages (usually) routed through some configuration of intermediary agents. ACA-Py agents use the did:peer DID method, which uses DIDs that are not published to a public verifiable data registry, but only shared privately between the communicating parties - usually just two agents.</p> <p>Given the underlying secure messaging layer (routing and encryption covered later in the \"Deeper Dive\" sections), DIDComm protocols define standard sets of messages to accomplish a task. For example:</p> <ul> <li>The \"DID exchange\" protocol enables two agents to establish a connection through a series of messages - an invitation, a connection request and a connection response.</li> <li>The \"issue credential\" protocol enables an agent to issue a credential to another agent.</li> <li>The \"present proof\" protocol enables an agent to request and receive a proof from another agent.</li> </ul> <p>Each protocol has a specification that defines the protocol's messages, one or more roles for the different participants, and a state machine that defines the state transitions triggered by the messages. For example, in the connection protocol, the messages are \"invitation\", \"connectionRequest\" and \"connectionResponse\", the roles are \"inviter\" and \"invitee\", and the states are \"invited\", \"requested\" and \"connected\". Each participant in an instance of a protocol tracks the state based on the messages they've seen.</p> <p>Code for protocols are implemented as externalized modules from the core agent code so that they can be included (or not) in an agent deployment. The protocol code must include the definition of a state object for the protocol, handlers for the protocol messages, and the events and administrative messages that are available to the controller to inject business logic into the running of the protocol. Each administrative message becomes part of the REST API exposed by the agent instance.</p> <p>Developers building ACA-Py agents for a particular use case will generally focus on building controllers. They must understand the protocols that they are going to need, including the events the controller will receive, and the protocol's administrative messages exposed via the REST API.

In that case, the Bob and the Routing Agent share the public key instead of the DID to their respective upstream routers.</p> <p>With the DIDDoc ready, Bob uses the path provided in the invitation to send a <code>connection-request</code> message to Alice with the new DID and DIDDoc. Alice now knows how to get any DIDComm message to Bob in a secure, end-to-end encrypted manner. Subsequently, when Alice sends messages to Bob's agent, she uses the information in the DIDDoc to securely send the message to the Agency endpoint, it is sent through to the Routing Agent and on to Bob's iPhone agent for processing.

This can happen where ACA-Py starts to publish an update to the RevReg, but the write transaction to the Hyperledger Indy ledger fails for some reason. When a credential revocation is published, ACA-Py (via indy-sdk or askar/credx) updates the revocation state in the wallet as well as on the ledger.  The revocation state is dependant on whatever the previous revocation state is/was, so if the ledger and wallet are mis-matched the publish will fail. (PR #1804 (merged) mitigates but probably doesn't completely eliminate this from happening).</p> <p>For example, in case we've seen, the write RevRegEntry transaction failed at the ledger because there was a problem with accepting the TAA (Transaction Author Agreement). Once the error occurred, the RevReg state held by the ACA-Py agent, and the RevReg state on the ledger were different. Even after the ability to write to the ledger was restored, the RevReg could still not be published because of the differences in the RevReg state. Such a situation can now be corrected, as follows:</p> <p>To address this issue, some new endpoints were added to ACA-Py in Release 0.7.4, as follows:</p> <ul> <li>GET <code>/revocation/registry/&lt;id&gt;/issued</code> - counts of the number of issued/revoked   within a registry</li> <li>GET <code>/revocation/registry/&lt;id&gt;/issued/details</code> - details of all credentials   issued/revoked within a registry</li> <li>GET <code>/revocation/registry/&lt;id&gt;/issued/indy_recs</code> - calculated rev_reg_delta from   the ledger</li> <li>This is used to compare ledger revoked vs wallet revoked credentials, which     is essentially the state of the RevReg on the ledger and in ACA-Py. Where     there is a difference, we have an error.</li> <li>PUT <code>/revocation/registry/&lt;id&gt;/fix-revocation-entry-state</code> - publish an update   to the RevReg state on the ledger to bring it into alignment with what is in   the ACA-Py instance.</li> <li>There is a boolean parameter (<code>apply_ledger_update</code>) to control whether the     ledger entry actually gets published so, if you are so inclined, you can     call the endpoint to see what the transaction would be, before you actually     try to do a ledger update.  This will return:<ul> <li><code>rev_reg_delta</code> - same as the \".../indy_recs\" endpoint</li> <li><code>accum_calculated</code> - transaction to write to ledger</li> <li><code>accum_fixed</code> - If <code>apply_ledger_update</code>, the transaction actually written   to the ledger</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Note that there is (currently) a backlog item to prevent the wallet and ledger from getting out of sync (e.g. don't update the ACA-Py RevReg state if the ledger write fails), but even after that change is made, having this ability will be retained for use if needed.</p> <p>We originally ran into this due to the TAA acceptance getting lost when switching to multi-ledger (as described here. Note that this is one reason how this \"out of sync\" scenario can occur, but there may be others.</p> <p>We add an integration test that demonstrates/tests this issue here.</p> <p>To run the scenario either manually or using the integration tests, you can do the following:</p> <ul> <li>Start von-network in TAA mode:</li> <li><code>./manage start --taa-sample --logs</code></li> <li>Start the tails server as usual:</li> <li><code>./manage start --logs</code></li> <li>To run the scenario manually, start faber and let the agent know it needs to TAA-accept before doing any ledger writes:</li> <li><code>./run_demo faber --revocation --taa-accept</code>, and then you can run through all the transactions using the Swagger page.</li> <li>To run the scenario via an integration test, run:</li> <li><code>./run_bdd -t @taa_required</code></li> </ul>"},{"location":"testing/UnitTests/","title":"ACA-Py Unit Tests","text":"<p>The following covers the Unit Testing framework in ACA-Py, how to run the tests, and how to add unit tests.</p> <p>This video is a presentation of the material covered in this document.</p>"},{"location":"testing/UnitTests/#running-unit-tests-in-aca-py","title":"Running unit tests in ACA-Py","text":"<ul> <li><code>./scripts/run_tests</code></li> <li><code>./scripts/run_tests acapy_agent/protocols/out_of_band/v1_0/tests</code></li> </ul> <p>Note: The <code>bbs</code> library is not installed with ACA-Py by default, therefore unit tests involving BBS Signatures are disabled.
