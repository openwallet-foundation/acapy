ACA-Py Code Documentation
===================================================

ACA-Py is a foundation for building decentralized
trust applications and services running in non-mobile environments.

This is the Read The Docs site for the OpenWallet Foundation's
`ACA-Py <https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy>`_.
This site contains only the ACA-Py docstrings documentation
extracted from the Python Code. For other documentation, please consult
the `ACA-Py <https://aca-py.org>`_ documentation site.

If you are getting started with verifiable credentials or ACA-Py,
we recommend that you start with this `verifiable credentials and agents
getting started guide
<https://aca-py.org/latest/gettingStarted/>`_.

Want to quick overview of the deployment model for ACA-Py? See 
`this document <https://aca-py.org/latest/deploying/deploymentModel/>`_.

To investigate the code, use search or click the package links in the left menu to
drill into the modules, subpackages and submodules that make up ACA-Py.

Developers that are interested in what DIDComm protocols are supported in ACA-Py
should take a look at the `protocols <generated/acapy_agent.protocols.html>`_ package. 
These should align with the corresponding
`aries-rfcs protocols <https://github.com/decentralized-identity/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features>`_.
Decorators defined in aries-rfcs and implemented in ACA-Py can be found
`here <generated/acapy_agent.messaging.decorators.html>`_.
Some general purpose subpackages that might be of interest include
`wallet <generated/acapy_agent.wallet.html>`_ and
`storage <generated/acapy_agent.storage.html>`_. For those
agents playing different roles in a verifiable credential exchange, take a look
at the `issuer <generated/acapy_agent.issuer.html>`_,
`holder <generated/acapy_agent.holder.html>`_ and
`verifier <generated/acapy_agent.verifier.html>`_ packages.
