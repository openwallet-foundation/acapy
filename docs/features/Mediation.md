# Mediation docs

## Concepts

- **DIDComm Message Forwarding** - Sending an encrypted message to its recipient by first sending it to a third party responsible for forwarding the message on. Message contents are encrypted once for the recipient then wrapped in a [forward message](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0094-cross-domain-messaging/README.md#corerouting10forward) encrypted to the third party.
- **Mediator** - An agent that forwards messages to a client over a DIDComm connection.
- **Mediated Agent** or **Mediation client** - The agent(s) to which a mediator is willing to forward messages.
- **Mediation Request** - A message from a client to a mediator requesting mediation or forwarding.
- **Keylist** - The list of public keys used by the mediator to lookup to which connection a forward message should be sent. Each mediated agent is responsible for maintaining the keylist with the mediator.
- **Keylist Update** - A message from a client to a mediator informing the mediator of changes to the keylist.
- **Default Mediator** - A mediator to be used with every newly created DIDComm connection.
- **Mediation Connection** - Connection between the mediator and the mediated agent or client. Agents can use as many mediators as the identity owner sees fit. Requests for mediation are handled on a per connection basis.
- See [Aries RFC 0211: Coordinate Mediation Protocol](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0211-route-coordination/README.md) for additional details on message attributes and more.

## Command Line Arguments

- `--open-mediation` - Instructs mediators to automatically grant all incoming mediation requests.
- `--mediator-invitation` - Receive invitation, send mediation request and set as default mediator.
- `--mediator-connections-invite` - Connect to mediator through a connection invitation. If not specified, connect using an OOB invitation.
- `--default-mediator-id` - Set pre-existing mediator as default mediator.
- `--clear-default-mediator` - Clear the stored default mediator.

The minimum set of arguments *required* to enable mediation are:

```bash
aca-py start ... \
    --open-mediation
```

To automate the mediation process on startup, *additionally* specify the following argument on the *mediated* agent (not the mediator):

```bash
aca-py start ... \
    --mediator-invitation "<a multi-use invitation url from the mediator>"
```

If a default mediator has already been established, then the `--default-mediator-id` argument can be used *instead* of the `--mediator-invitation`.

## DIDComm Messages

See [Aries RFC 0211: Coordinate Mediation Protocol](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0211-route-coordination/README.md).

## Admin API

- `GET mediation/requests`
  - Return a list of all mediation records. Filter by `conn_id`, `state`, `mediator_terms` and `recipient_terms`.
- `GET mediation/requests/{mediation_id}`
  - Retrieve a mediation record by id.
- `DELETE mediation/requests/{mediation_id}`
  - Delete mediation record by id.
- `POST mediation/requests/{mediation_id}/grant`
  - As a mediator, grant a stored mediation request and send `granted` message to client.
- `POST mediation/requests/{mediation_id}/deny`
  - As a mediator, deny a stored mediation request and send `denied` message to client.
- `POST mediation/request/{conn_id}`
  - Send a mediation request to connection identified by the given connection ID.
- `GET mediation/keylists`
  - Returns key list associated with a connection. Filter on `client` for keys mediated by other agents and `server` for keys mediated by this agent.
- `POST mediation/keylists/{mediation_id}/send-keylist-update`
  - Send keylist update message to mediator identified by the given mediation ID. Updates contained in body of request.
- `POST mediation/keylists/{mediation_id}/send-keylist-query`
  - Send keylist query message to mediator identified by the given mediation ID.
- `GET mediation/default-mediator` **(PR pending)**
  - Retrieve the currently set default mediator.
- `PUT mediation/{mediation_id}/default-mediator` **(PR pending)**
  - Set the mediator identified by the given mediation ID as the default mediator.
- `DELETE mediation/default-mediator` **(PR pending)**
  - Clear the currently set default mediator (mediation status is maintained and remains functional, just not used as the default).

## Mediator Message Flow Overview

![Mediator Message Flow](../assets/mediation-message-flow.png)

## Using a Mediator

After establishing a connection with a mediator also having mediation granted, you can use that mediator id for future did_comm connections.
 When creating, receiving or accepting an invitation intended to be Mediated, you provide `mediation_id` with the desired mediator id. if using a single mediator for all future connections, You can set a default mediation id. If no mediation_id is provided the default mediation id will be used instead.
