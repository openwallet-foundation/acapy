[Hyperledger AnonCreds]: https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/anoncreds

## DID Methods

| Method | Supported | Notes |
| --- | :--: | -- |
| "unqualified" | :warning: Deprecated | Pre-DID standard identifiers. Used either in a peer-to-peer context, or as an alternate form of a `did:sov` DID published on an Indy network. |
| `did:sov` | :white_check_mark: |  |
| `did:web` | :white_check_mark: | Resolution only |
| `did:key` | :white_check_mark: | |
| `did:peer` | :white_check_mark:| Algorithms `2`/`3` and `4` |

## Secure Storage Types

| Secure Storage Types | Supported | Notes |
| --- | :--: | -- |
| [Aries Askar] | :white_check_mark: | Recommended - Aries Askar provides equivalent/evolved secure storage and cryptography support to the "indy-wallet" part of the Indy SDK. When using Askar (via the `--wallet-type askar` startup parameter), other functionality is handled by [CredX](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs) (AnonCreds) and [Indy VDR](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) (Indy ledger interactions). |
| [Aries Askar]-AnonCreds | :white_check_mark: | Recommended - When using Askar/AnonCreds (via the `--wallet-type askar-anoncreds` startup parameter), other functionality is handled by [AnonCreds RS](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs) (AnonCreds) and [Indy VDR](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) (Indy ledger interactions).<br><br>This `wallet-type` will eventually be the same as `askar` when we have fully integrated the AnonCreds RS library into ACA-Py. |
| [Indy SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/design/003-wallet-storage) | :x: | **Removed in ACA-Py Release 1.0.0rc5** |

> Existing deployments using the [Indy SDK] **MUST** transition to [Aries Askar] and related components as soon as possible. See the [Indy SDK to Askar Migration Guide] for guidance.

## Miscellaneous Features

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
| --- | :--: | -- |
| ACA-Py Plugins | :white_check_mark:  | The [ACA-Py Plugins] repository contains a growing set of plugins that are maintained and (mostly) tested against new releases of ACA-Py. |
| Multi use invitations            | :white_check_mark:  |         |
| Invitations using public did     | :white_check_mark:        |         |
| Invitations using peer dids supporting connection reuse     | :white_check_mark:        |         |
| Implicit pickup of messages in role of mediator | :white_check_mark:        |         |
| [Revocable AnonCreds Credentials](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/main/text/0011-cred-revocation) | :white_check_mark:        |         |
| Multi-Tenancy      | :white_check_mark:        | [Documentation](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy/blob/main/Multitenancy.md) |
| Multi-Tenant Management | :white_check_mark: | The [Traction] open source project from BC Gov is a layer on top of ACA-Py that enables the easy management of ACA-Py tenants, with an Administrative UI ("The Innkeeper") and a Tenant UI for using ACA-Py in a web UI (setting up, issuing, holding and verifying credentials) |
| Connection-less (non OOB protocol / AIP 1.0)               | :white_check_mark:        | Only for issue credential and present proof          |
| Connection-less (OOB protocol / AIP 2.0)               | :white_check_mark:        | Only for present proof          |
| Signed Attachments               | :white_check_mark:        | Used for OOB         |
| Multi Indy ledger support (with automatic detection) | :white_check_mark: | Support added in the 0.7.3 Release.   |
| Persistence of mediated messages | :white_check_mark:        | Plugins in the [ACA-Py Plugins] repository are available for persistent queue support using Redis and Kafka. Without persistent queue support, messages are stored in an in-memory queue and so are subject to loss in the case of a sudden termination of an ACA-Py process. The in-memory queue is properly handled in the case of a graceful shutdown of an ACA-Py process (e.g. processing of the queue completes and no new messages are accepted).  |
| Storage Import & Export           | :warning:        | Supported by directly interacting with the Aries Askar (e.g., no Admin API endpoint available for wallet import & export). Aries Askar support includes the ability to import storage exported from the Indy SDK's "indy-wallet" component. Documentation for migrating from Indy SDK storage to Askar can be found in the [Indy SDK to Askar Migration Guide].|
| SD-JWTs | :white_check_mark: | Signing and verifying SD-JWTs is supported |

## Supported RFCs

### AIP 1.0

Most RFCs listed in [AIP
1.0](https://identity.foundation/aries-rfcs/latest/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/#aries-interop-profile-version-10)
are fully supported in ACA-Py, but deprecation and removal of some of the
protocols has begun. The following table provides notes about the implementation
of specific RFCs.

| RFC | Supported | Notes |
| --- | :--: | -- |
| [0025-didcomm-transports](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/b490ebe492985e1be9804fc0763119238b2e51ab/features/0025-didcomm-transports)      | :white_check_mark:        | ACA-Py currently supports HTTP and WebSockets for both inbound and outbound messaging. Transports are pluggable and an agent instance can use multiple inbound and outbound transports.|
| [0160-connection-protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/9b0aaa39df7e8bd434126c4b33c097aae78d65bf/features/0160-connection-protocol)    | :x:        | **MOVED TO PLUGIN** The protocol has been moved into the [ACA-Py plugin] repository. Those upgrading to Release 1.3.0 or later and continuing to use this protocol **MUST** include the [Connections plugin](https://plugins.aca-py.org/latest/connections/) in their deployment configuration. Users **SHOULD** upgrade to the equivalent [AIP 2.0] protocols as soon as possible. |
| [0036-issue-credential-v1.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/bb42a6c35e0d5543718fb36dd099551ab192f7b0/features/0036-issue-credential)    | :white_check_mark:        | **DEPRECATED** In the next release, the protocol will be removed. The protocol will continue to be available as an [ACA-Py plugin], but those upgrading to that pending release and continuing to use this protocol will need to include the plugin in their deployment configuration. Users **SHOULD** upgrade to the equivalent [AIP 2.0] protocols as soon as possible.  |
| [0037-present-proof-v1.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/4fae574c03f9f1013db30bf2c0c676b1122f7149/features/0037-present-proof)    | :white_check_mark:        | **DEPRECATED** In the next release, the protocol will be removed. It will continue to be available as an [ACA-Py plugin], but those upgrading to that pending release and continuing to use this protocol will need to include the plugin in their deployment configuration. Users **SHOULD** upgrade to the equivalent [AIP 2.0] protocols as soon as possible. |
