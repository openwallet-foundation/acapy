# What is ACA-Py?

ACA-Py is a shared, reusable, interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. It is infrastructure for trusted, decentralized, peer-to-peer interactions. It includes a shared secure storage and a key management service for clients, as well as communication protocols for trusted interaction between agents.  

An ACA-Py agent (such as the one in this repository):

* enables establishing connections with other DIDComm-based agents (using DIDComm encryption envelopes),
* exchanges messages between connected agents to execute message protocols using DIDComm and other protocols,
* sends notifications about protocol events to a controller, and
* exposes an API for responses from the controller with direction in handling protocol events.

The some of the concepts and features that make up the ACA-Py project are documented in the [aries-rfcs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/aries-rfcs) - but **don't** dive in there yet! We'll get to the features and concepts to be found there with a guided tour of the key RFCs.
