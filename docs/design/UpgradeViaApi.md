# Upgrade via API Design

## Design Goals

To isolate an upgrade process and trigger it via API the following pattern was designed to handle multitenant scenarios. It includes an is_upgrading record in the wallet(DB) and a middleware to prevent requests during the upgrade process.

## Flow

The diagram below describes the sequence of events for the anoncreds upgrade process which it was designed, but the architecture can be used for any upgrade process.

    participant A1 as Agent 1
    participant M1 as Middleware
    participant IAS1 as IsAnonCredsSingleton Set
    participant UIPS1 as UpgradeInProgressSingleton Set
    participant W as Wallet (DB)
    participant UIPS2 as UpgradeInProgressSingleton Set
    participant IAS2 as IsAnonCredsSingleton Set
    participant M2 as Middleware
    participant A2 as Agent 2

    Note over A1,A2: Start upgrade for non-anoncreds wallet
    A1->>M1: POST /anoncreds/wallet/upgrade
    M1-->>IAS1: check if wallet is in set
    IAS1-->>M1: wallet is not in set
    M1-->>UIPS1: check if wallet is in set
    UIPS1-->>M1: wallet is not in set
    M1->>A1: OK
    A1-->>W: Add is_upgrading = anoncreds_in_progress record
    A1->>A1: Upgrade wallet
    A1-->>UIPS1: Add wallet to set

    Note over A1,A2: Attempted Requests During Upgrade

    Note over A1: Attempted Request
    A1->>M1: GET /any-endpoint
    M1-->>IAS1: check if wallet is in set
    IAS1-->>M1: wallet is not in set
    M1-->>UIPS1: check if wallet is in set
    UIPS1-->>M1: wallet is in set
    M1->>A1: 503 Service Unavailable

    Note over A2: Attempted Request
    A2->>M2: GET /any-endpoint
    M2-->>IAS2: check if wallet is in set
    IAS2->>M2: wallet is not in set
    M2-->>UIPS2: check if wallet is in set
    UIPS2-->>M2: wallet is not in set
    A2-->>W: Query is_upgrading = anoncreds_in_progress record
    W-->>A2: record = anoncreds_in_progress
    A2->>A2: Loop until upgrade is finished in seperate process
    A2-->>UIPS2: Add wallet to set
    M2->>A2: 503 Service Unavailable

    Note over A1,A2: Agent Restart During Upgrade
    A1-->>W: Get is_upgrading record for wallet or all subwallets
    W-->>A1: 
    A1->>A1: Resume upgrade if in progress
    A1-->>UIPS1: Add wallet to set

    Note over A2: Same as Agent 1

    Note over A1,A2: Upgrade Completes

    Note over A1: Finish Upgrade
    A1-->>W: set is_upgrading = anoncreds_finished
    A1-->>UIPS1: Remove wallet from set
    A1-->>IAS1: Add wallet to set
    A1->>A1: update subwallet or restart

    Note over A2: Detect Upgrade Complete
    A2-->>W: Check is_upgrading = anoncreds_finished
    W-->>A2: record = anoncreds_in_progress
    A2->>A2: Wait 1 second
    A2-->>W: Check is_upgrading = anoncreds_finished
    W-->>A2: record = anoncreds_finished
    A2-->>UIPS2: Remove wallet from set
    A2-->>IAS2: Add wallet to set
    A2->>A2: update subwallet or restart

    Note over A1,A2: Restarted Agents After Upgrade

    A1-->W: Get is_upgrading record for wallet or all subwallets
    W-->>A1: 
    A1->>IAS1: Add wallet to set if record = anoncreds_finished

    Note over A2: Same as Agent 1

    Note over A1,A2: Attempted Requests After Upgrade

    Note over A1: Attempted Request
    A1->>M1: GET /any-endpoint
    M1-->>IAS1: check if wallet is in set
    IAS1-->>M1: wallet is in set
    M1-->>A1: OK

    Note over A2: Same as Agent 1
```

## Example

An example of the implementation can be found via the anoncreds upgrade components.

- `acapy_agent/wallet/routes.py` in the `upgrade_anoncreds` controller 
- the upgrade code in `wallet/anoncreds_upgrade.py`
- the middleware in `admin/server.py` in the `upgrade_middleware` function
- the singleton sets in `wallet/singletons.py`
- the startup process in `core/conductor.py` in the `check_for_wallet_upgrades_in_progress` function
